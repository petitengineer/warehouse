This is the backend for an inventory tracking web application. It was created specifically for Shopify's Fall 2022 Internship Challenge.

It is also my first ever web application. I used it to help myself better understand Python & Django, SQL, and concepts behind web development.


## HOW TO USE THIS WEB APPLICATION

This section has been intentionally left blank because I have not yet completed the application. I will update it later.

## NOTES FOR SELF
**How to guide for Git**
git init (initialize the repo)
git add 
git commit -m "your commit message"
git branch -M main (selects the branch)
git remote add origin <link to repo>
git push -u origin main


Keep code cohesive and uncoupled.
