This is the backend for an inventory tracking web application.

It is also my first ever web application. I used it to help myself better understand Python & Django, SQL, and concepts behind web development.



## NOTES FOR SELF
**How to guide for Git**
git init (initialize the repo)
git add 
git commit -m "your commit message"
git branch -M main (selects the branch)
git remote add origin <link to repo>
git push -u origin main

To see the commit log:
git log --oneline
To move the header to the previous commit (i.e. move back by one):
git reset --hard HEAD~1

Keep code cohesive and uncoupled.
