This is the backend for an inventory tracking web application. It was created specifically for Shopify's Fall 2022 Internship Challenge.

It is also my first ever web application. I used it to help myself better understand Python & Django, SQL, and concepts behind web development.


## HOW TO USE THIS WEB APPLICATION

This section has been intentionally left blank because I have not yet completed the application. I will update it later.
